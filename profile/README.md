HamTrunk‚Ñ¢
=========

We're excited to share our **Motorola Type II** trunking system with you: operated in the **70cm amateur band**, it is lovingly referred to as the **HamTrunk‚Ñ¢**!

The trunking system is typically installed in/on **T4**, a retired fire truck üöí that served the municipalities of Baltimore, MD and Waterbury, CT before it came into our possession. It is now used as a mobile radio tower for our system, as well as hosting other partner groups at events.

We aim to educate amateur radio enthusiasts about trunking technology and setting up repeaters.
